道連れ
共倒れ

fall together


顔色悪くわない	

I'm going to a driving camp tomorrow. I'm a little nervous, but also excited.
I hope it adds some fun to my otherwise boring daily routine


i havent been get up before 7am for a while, it be a little change for me to get up at 6.
but i view it as a opportunity to change my lifestyle 

希望我能一帆风顺的在时间内考到驾照
如果没有在指定时间内考到驾照 我会有很大的麻烦

I really hope everything goes smoothly and I can get my driver's license on time. If I don’t pass by the deadline, it could lead to a lot of problems for me."
