igot very luck
peaceful decade 


be close to fire

I feel incredibly fortunate to have been born in a relatively peaceful decade. 
While I may not consider myself the luckiest person of this era, I still recognize how much I’ve been given compared to those who lived through the chaos of history. 
So many generations before us endured devastating wars, deadly pandemics, oppression, and uncertainty on a daily basis. 
In contrast, I have the freedom to dream, to learn, and to build a life of my own choosing. 
For that, I’m deeply grateful—not only to the people who support me now, but also to those in the past who fought for the peace and progress I benefit from today. 
I don’t want to take any of it for granted.

Honestly, I feel really lucky to have been born in a peaceful time. I might not be the luckiest person out there, but when I think about everything people went through in the past—wars, pandemics, so much suffering—it makes me realize how good I have it. Just being able to live, grow, and chase my goals without constant fear is something I don’t want to take for granted. I’m super grateful for the people around me and for the peace that allows me to enjoy the little things in life. It’s not perfect, but compared to what others had to face, I know I’m blessed.
