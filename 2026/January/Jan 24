First time snowboard with kokomi and her friends

I went sbowboarding for the first time with kokomi and her friends,

and it was a very happy experience/ blast,

talked to taiwanese people and learnt about taiwan play culture..


like they like to introduce to each other kind of formally, 
It may also exist in mainland china culture, but, its more causually.
and taiwanese like to talk about 星座，its also exist in certain group in mainland china，
especially girls, but nowadays, even girls don't talk 星座 in china.
Also, they have a lot of interests expecially outdoor activities in general, 
Even back when they were students in taiwan, they were already attend various outdoor activities,
in China, other than big cities, people usually don't have specific outdoor activities, usually just hang out with friends, throwing a party, or play some major sports like basketball.



- Despite the differences, we all got really hyped up  for the New Year.
- differences 

but there are still similarities between china and taiwan group,
they are also hype on new years, 
talking about the similar foods.
and, compare to japanese people, they are 表裏一体 in which we are similar.

还有一些差异
是中国大陆人要随意很多
比如说台湾人一起聊天 大部分人会参与 或许一两个人会干自己的事情
但是大陆人的话 基本上不感兴趣组会做自己的事情 刷手机 发呆 或者分成好几个聊天组
