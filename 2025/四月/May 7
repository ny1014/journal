where do you see in five years
where do you see yourself in five years


Because I'm studying for my driver's license, I have to stay at a training camp where the internet gets cut off before 11 p.m. I see this as a chance to fix my sleep schedule and take a break from social media like Instagram. I'll also try to make some new friends while I'm there.

Quit smoking


no SNS

11 / 11  and 2 hours cutoff usually between 7 - 9
get my schedule back on track

If I stick to my current habits and lifestyle, I might become an average person who’s just slightly above the norm in five years. But I don’t want to be just average — I want to be excellent. I want to be in at least the top 2%.

To reach that goal in five years, I need to change the direction I'm heading in. I also need to clearly define what being in the top 2% means to me, and take real, consistent action to get there.



Top 2% Threshold: ¥20 million per year, which is over three times the national average.


While most people drift, they steer.
