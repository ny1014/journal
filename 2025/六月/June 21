運転の楽しい方
	楽しいと練習




其实我可以睡的很好
比如在自动车学校的宿舍
在我老家的大床上
我可以轻松的睡九个小时
但在我自己的单间里 我最多只能睡七个小时 中间还会醒来
I sleep away from home like once or twice a month but somehow sleep way better. Hotel bed or my parents’ place? Nine hours easy. In my own apartment? Seven hours max and I always wake up at least once. How is my own bed the worst place to sleep?
