Dopamine releases into our systems through two main mechanisms; tonic and phasic release. 
Tonic release refers to the minimum level of dopamine constantly circulating in your system that is required to maintain the body’s basic functions. Such functions include the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and the will to go to work and earn despite preferring to spend the day on the couch.
When in a deficit, we experience a lack of motivation and energy to perform even basic everyday tasks. Postpartum depression is a common experience, where after nine months of pregnancy and much anticipation, plummeting dopamine levels after birth take days or weeks to renew.
