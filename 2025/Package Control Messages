Package Control
---------------

  Version 4.0.0 Release Notes
  ===========================


  Major Changes
  -------------

  - Requires at least ST3143 (1.0)

  - drops support for python 2.x

  - adds support for python 3.8

  - Package and library version scheme changed from SemVer to PEP440
    for better pre-release handling and compatibility with python packages.

    Note: Package versions should still follow SemVer like `<major>.<minor>.<micro>`

  - Dependencies are now called libraries.

    They are installed to Data/Libs as ordinary python packages.

    Existing managed dependencies are automatically converted.

    Can install python wheels (*.whl)

  - Channel/repository scheme v1.0 and v1.2 are no longer supported
    as they contain only packages for no longer supported ST2.

  - New channel/repository scheme v4.0.0 is introduced,
    which allows to specify supported `python_versions`.

    Parsing and installing "requirements.txt" is however not yet supported.

    For working examples checkout example-channel.json and example-repository.json
    from Package Control Github repository.


  Note for Package Devs
  ---------------------

    packagecontrol.io does not yet support the new 4.0.0 scheme
    and thus doesn't ship python 3.8 dependencies/libraries.

    Therefore do not upgrade repositories to 4.0.0 scheme,
    which are included in default channel.

    You can however create your own 4.0.0 repository and
    add it via 'Package Control: Add Repository'.

    Metadata for python 3.8 compatible libraries are maintained at

      https://github.com/packagecontrol/channel

    and shipped via

      https://packagecontrol.github.io/channel/channel_v4.json

    so all packages can already migrate to python 3.8

  ---------------------

    - support for python 3.8 dependencies (now called libraries)
    - add openssl 3.0 support via asn1crypto 1.5.1 and oscrypto 1.3.0
