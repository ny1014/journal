"I want to learn a musical instrument to cultivate my character and better express emotions."


astronomer
When I was a child, I dreamed of becoming an astronomer。
because I was deeply curious about the unknown. 

Every time I looked up at the stars in the sky, I was struck by how small I felt. Yet, instead of feeling sad, it brought me a sense of calm and helped me forget some of my worries.
However, I never really considered astronomy as a career. 
Back then, I probably saw it more as a lifelong passion rather than a job. 

My childhood idol was Einstein because he was such a brilliant scientist.
