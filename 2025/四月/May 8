If there's no one there
if no one is there.
If there's someone there, he won't go.
But if someone else is there.

How should we divide our time?

……look it up on the internet. 
If I’m confused about something, I usually look it up on the internet.



💬 Dialogue: Time Management for a Group Assignment
Tom: We only have one week to finish the assignment. We need to manage our time wisely.
（我们只有一周时间完成作业，得好好分配时间。）

Lily: I agree. How about we break the task into three parts and set deadlines for each?
（同意。我们把任务分成三部分，然后给每部分设个截止时间怎么样？）

Jason: That works. Maybe we can do research by Monday, write the report by Wednesday, and prepare the slides by Friday?
（可以。也许我们可以在周一前完成调研，周三前写报告，周五前做幻灯片？）

Tom: Sounds reasonable. How much time should we spend on each part?

Lily: Research might take the longest—maybe two days. The writing could be done in a day and a half, and the slides will take one day.

Jason: Good. Let’s stick to that schedule and check in every two days to stay on track.

Tom: Deal. I’ll create a shared calendar and send reminders.
