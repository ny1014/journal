	So I need to cut down on my social media use—like X and Instagram.
	I should batch-reply to messages instead of checking them constantly.
	And I need to cut back on checking the stock market as well.

	cut back on checking the stock market to stabilize my dopamine baseline and maintain focus.

Schools should teach practical skills rather than academic subjects. To what extent do you agree?
	No, i dont agree.
	imo, there is a good balance between practical skills and academic subject.
	there are subjects like math, you need to learn the theory 
	and rememeber the 公式 if necessary 
	also, subjects like physical and chemistry,
	its important to know the thery before doing any hands-on.
	even if subjects like sports and art, 
	those are sounded like practical skills but i need to learn the theory before practicing

⭐ Improved IELTS Version (your ideas → polished English)

I do not agree with the idea that schools should prioritise practical skills over academic subjects. In my opinion, a healthy education system requires a balance between the two. Many subjects simply cannot be learned through practice alone. For example, mathematics relies heavily on theoretical understanding; before applying formulas, students must first learn the underlying concepts. The same is true for physics and chemistry, where knowing the theory is essential before conducting any hands-on experiments, both for accuracy and safety. Even subjects that appear purely practical, such as sports or art, require a theoretical foundation. Athletes need to understand technique and body mechanics, and artists benefit from learning principles like colour theory or composition. Therefore, academic knowledge and practical skills complement each other rather than compete, and schools should maintain a balanced approach.


我认为我的英语学习需要时间
起码半年起的展望
这半年优先口语和写作
然后听力
然后半年后考一次雅思
我需要寻找一起备考的伙伴

回顾我之前的学习方式
我努力读了很多英文书籍
而且笔记了很多很难的单词和谚语
但这些对我现在的水平来说使用场景有限
所以效率极差

However, at my current level, these words rarely appear in everyday communication or IELTS tasks, so the return on investment was very low. In other words, my effort did not translate into practical improvement, which made my learning inefficient.
