 pitch in

 enrich it in natural dialogs

Here's a version with more natural dialog:
"Look, we don't have super strict phone rules here," Jake from HR might explain during orientation, "but that doesn't mean you can just be scrolling Instagram all day."
He'd probably lean in and add, "Your boss will definitely notice if you're constantly on your phone instead of working. And trust me, your coworkers will get annoyed. Nobody wants to pick up your slack because you're distracted."
The key is finding that sweet spot - checking your phone occasionally is fine, but don't make it a habit. Quick text? Sure. Marathon social media session? Nope. Stay professional, stay focused, and use your phone sparingly during work hours.


You: Ugh, I can’t stand how dry and noisy our office is. The AC is set way too high, and it’s just so uncomfortable.

Coworker: I know, right? My throat gets so dry by the end of the day. And don’t get me started on the noise—it’s hard to concentrate sometimes.

You: Exactly! The low humidity is killing my skin too. I’m tempted to bring a humidifier in here.

Coworker: That’s not a bad idea, actually. Maybe we could talk to management about adjusting the AC or getting some plants for the office—they help with the air quality.

You: Yeah, plants would definitely help. And maybe some noise-canceling panels or even headphones could make things better too.

Coworker: Good point. Let’s bring it up at the next team meeting. If more people feel the same, we might actually get them to change something.

You: Sounds like a plan. Thanks for being on the same page—I thought I was the only one annoyed by all this!

Coworker: No way, you’re not alone. Let’s see if we can make it a better space for everyone.
