My baseline is quite high compared to the average person. I attribute that to my self-discipline and daily routine.

 The Emotional Rollercoaster: “Too High → Slump”
 So yes, stability > intensity. Let’s talk how to cultivate that 👇

Why don’t I go back to China?

Because I dream of being a digital nomad.
You know, our ancestors lived nomadic lives — it's in our genes.
So I’m just following what’s already wired into me. Makes sense, right?

Also, the Chinese economy hasn’t been doing great in recent years.
Sure, you can get a high paycheck if you have a very specialized skill or expertise.
If you stay sharp and competitive, you’ll be fine.
But for the average person, in terms of job security,
Japan is way better than China.



Because I’ve always dreamed of living as a digital nomad.
It’s kind of poetic, actually — our ancestors were nomadic, always on the move, adapting to new environments.
That lifestyle is in our DNA, and I guess I’m just following that instinct. It feels natural to me.

On top of that, let’s be real — China’s economy hasn’t exactly been thriving in recent years.
Sure, if you’ve got a rare skill set or deep expertise, you can still earn a high salary and stay ahead of the curve.
But for the average person, things aren’t so stable. The job market is tough, and competition is intense.
In comparison, Japan offers much more stability, especially when it comes to job security.
So from both a personal and practical perspective, Japan just makes more sense right now.
