what if ...
what if i have done this ... 
something you failed or missed you can realize it in hindsight 
but something really important you missed you can not even realize its existence
so, i need always be mindful about what if i have done this ...  how about i have done that 
always keep in mind what is really matter to you 

i really need to start commitment initially 
first like fullfill my calendar
like when im gonna to visit my family, friend..
check social event beforehand, not just a quick random meet up 
plan a party before hand 
take initiative is really important 


人間万事塞翁が馬
--------
Sometimes, when I fail or miss something, I can realize it in hindsight.
But the truly important things — the ones I completely miss — I may never even become aware of.
That’s why I try to stay mindful and always ask myself:
What if I had done this? What if I had tried that?
Not all mistakes are visible. Some I recognize only in hindsight.
But the most critical ones might pass unnoticed, forever unknown.
So I remind myself to stay mindful, to wonder: What if I had taken that path? What if I had chosen differently?


People not getting alone
people like oil and water

4. Growth-Oriented Reflection

What have I learned from this?
How can I do better next time?
Who do I want to become?
Am I being true to myself?
