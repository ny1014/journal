Value Investing
Mr. Market

“Not just a dopamine spark, but long-term happiness.”
长期价值大于短期刺激：别被短暂的表面吸引，真正有价值的关系是长期稳定的。


Choose what lasts, not what flashes.
Not just a dopamine spark, but long-term happiness

True value lies in the long run, not in short-term thrills. Don’t be swayed by temporary excitement—whether in investing or relationships, what truly matters is stability and lasting meaning.


While you’re young, invest in things that never depreciate—your mind, your voice, your emotions, your skills, and your body.
The earlier you invest in them, the more they compound over time.
