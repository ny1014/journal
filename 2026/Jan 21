I rejoined my gym membership yesterday.
initial fee is 10.000en 
monthly fee is 3200 en
its a quite reasonable price  
but there is a catch, you have to continue to a total year otherwise you need to pay the cancel fee, if you canceled it in 6 months, you would pay 2 month fee, if you canceled it in 12 months, you need to pay 1 month fee

“initial pay” → “initial fee” / “sign-up fee”
pay a cancellation fee.
one-year commitment.
Canceling early results in a penalty
quit
Canceling early results in a penalty: 2 months' fee if I quit within the first 6 months, or 1 month's fee if I quit within a year.
commitment/contract
In English, we often use the word "penalty" when talking about fees for breaking a contract.
