Advancing technology has made it increasingly possible for people to work from home with limited social interaction. At the same time, solitary activities such as online gaming and food delivery services allow individuals to stay indoors more comfortably than ever.

Some people argue that humans are social animals by nature and therefore need to build a wide circle of friends. Others, however, contend that modern society has changed significantly, making it possible to lead a fulfilling life with only a few close relationships.
