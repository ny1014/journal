Person A: So what kind of goals are you working toward?

Friend/Mentor: What’s been on your mind lately?

You: I’ve been thinking a lot about where I’m headed. I want to be someone who can connect with anyone, no matter their gender, age, background, or education. Being able to understand and communicate with different types of people—that’s a skill I really want to build.

Friend/Mentor: That’s a great mindset. What else?

You: I also want to start taking on leadership roles, learning how money really works—investing, saving, financial independence—all of it. And I know I’ll need to take some risks along the way. Playing it safe all the time won’t get me where I want to be.

Friend/Mentor: That’s true. Playing it safe might feel comfortable now, but in the long run, it can hold you back. The fact that you’re aware of this is a huge first step.

You: Yeah… I just feel like if I don’t push myself now, I’m going to look back and realize I haven’t achieved anything meaningful.

Friend/Mentor: Then don’t wait. Start small if you have to, but start. Take that risk, start that project, talk to that person. Growth only happens when you step outside what’s easy.
