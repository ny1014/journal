A: Looks like the jet lag is making you healthier. 
		。。。。What time do you usually get up?


Yeah, that’s true. I’m wondering if I should try to keep this habit going — do you think it’s worth it?
It actually makes me feel better during the day. Do you notice a difference when you wake up early vs. late?

Maybe I should thank jet lag for fixing my sleep schedule — has that ever happened to you?

时间的奥秘不在于它的长短，而在于你如何用经历为它标注深度
给每段时间起一个名字


Polished English Version
I wasted too much time in the past—
time that could have been spent doing meaningful things,
time that could have created memories worth cherishing.
But I let it slip away and didn’t do much that truly mattered.
Still, what’s past is past.
I shouldn’t dwell on regret or sunk costs.
Instead, I should learn from my mistakes and face the future head-on.
I still have plenty of time ahead of me,
and my past failures only make me value that time even more.

1. 为什么 VGT 看起来“头重脚轻”
权重设计：它是市值加权（market-cap weighted），大公司越大，权重越高，小公司基本被稀释。
结果：VGT 的表现和风险，和你直接买 NVDA + MSFT + AAPL，其实高度相关。很多小票在里面基本就是“装饰”。
本质：它是“科技巨头 + 一些小公司”，而不是“均衡科技篮子”。
