A: Nice! Are you keeping up with the lessons?
B: Not really… I’m about four or five days behind.


- hectic

A: Still going to the gym regularly?
B: Kinda. I’m trying to keep up with my routine, but work’s been hectic.
A: Yeah, consistency is the hardest part.
B: Tell me about it. Skipping one day throws off my whole rhythm.


- throw me off /disrupt
	 That unexpected meeting threw off my entire schedule.
	 Skipping breakfast really throws off my whole morning.


- get here

A: Hey, when did you get here?
B: Just about a week ago.

- give or take


A: How long is your course?
B: It’s around three weeks, give or take.

A: When will you finish and leave?
B: If everything goes smoothly, I should be done by the end of next week.

- go for a walk

A: What do you usually do in your free time when there’s no driving class?
B: I just relax, maybe watch some videos or go for a walk. Sometimes I review the lessons too.
	B: Chill mostly. Watch stuff, scroll on my phone, maybe take a walk.

A: How do you like life here so far?
B: It’s not bad. A bit quiet, but the pace is nice and the people are friendly.

A: How’s life here treating you so far?
B: Not bad. Kinda quiet, but it’s nice. Good vibe.


driver’s license?

whats your plan after you get your driving liscence 
will you drive often or just keep it as a paper 
me, i dont think i will drive often 
the only situation i will drive may be is when i travel along, i will rent a car.
but if i was in a group, i definitely not the driving person, im bad at driving and direction, and my focus span is short.


A: So, what’s your plan after you get your driver’s license?
B: Are you gonna drive a lot, or just keep it as a backup?

A: Me? I don’t think I’ll drive much.
The only time I’d probably drive is when I’m traveling alone and rent a car.
But if I’m with a group, I’m definitely not the one driving.
I’m not good at driving or directions, and honestly, my attention span is pretty short.

張り詰めた
見立てだとね
ちょっと顔かして

叱ってほしかった
叱られて楽になるのは
成り立てない

根も葉もない噂
