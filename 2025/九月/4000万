4000万
如果每年定投 300万日元 到 S&P 500，假设年化收益率 10%，15年后大约会变成：
👉 约 95,317,445 日元（约 9531万日元）


如果你每年定投 300万日元 到 S&P 500，年化收益率 10%：
20年后停止定投 时，本金加收益大约是 1.72亿日元。
停止定投后不再投入，但继续放着复利增长 10年，到第30年时会变成：
👉 约 4.46亿日元（约 4亿4567万日元）


如果你：
第1年投入本金 1000万日元
之后每年再定投 200万日元
持续定投 20年 后停止
然后不再投入，只放着到 30年
在年化 10% 的情况下：
1000万本金 经过30年复利：约 1.74亿日元
20年定投200万，继续增长到30年：约 2.97亿日元
合计 👉 4.72亿日元（约 4亿7160万日元）


如果你：
第一年投入 1500万日元
之后每年 200万日元，持续 10年
年化收益率 10%
然后停止定投，不再投入，只放着到 20年
那么在 第20年末 时：
👉 资产大约是 1.84亿日元



如果你：
第一年投入 1500万日元
之后每年 200万日元，持续 15年
年化收益率 11%
然后停止定投，只放着不再投入
那么结果大致是：
15年后：约 1.41亿日元
初始本金部分：约 7180万
15年定投部分：约 6880万
继续放着不投：
20年后：约 2.37亿日元
25年后：约 3.99亿日元
30年后：约 6.73亿日元





现在350万

找个熊市600  目前200 到600（大概需要一年的存款）

第二个熊市600  一年不太可能有两个熊市 大概两三年 第二笔大笔入市

健康的复利
🔑 Explanation in English
The compounding of reputation and influence means that the trust, credibility, and positive impressions you build over time do not grow linearly—they grow exponentially, like financial compound interest.
Reputation: Every honest action, delivered promise, or piece of valuable work adds a “unit” of trust. Over time, these units accumulate and make people more likely to support you, recommend you, or give you opportunities.
Influence: Once your reputation reaches a certain threshold, your ability to persuade, inspire, or mobilize others expands rapidly, often with less effort than before.
In other words, small, consistent deposits into your “trust account” eventually generate large returns in the form of opportunities, partnerships, and authority.
📌 Key Characteristics
Exponential Growth
At first, reputation builds slowly (like financial compounding in the early years).
Later, even small actions can have a massive effect, because you’re building on an existing foundation.
Network Effects
Your reputation spreads through word of mouth. One positive interaction leads to more, creating a multiplier effect.
Fragility
Like financial capital, reputation is hard to build but easy to destroy. A single act of dishonesty can erase years of compounding.
💡 Example
If you consistently share valuable insights online, only a few people may notice in the beginning.
After a few years, your articles are quoted, your followers grow, and you’re invited to speak at conferences.
Later, opportunities find you—because your reputation and influence have compounded.
