something about relationship, 

if i only know a person, even though i quite familiar with him or her,
since i ve been known him or her very (很长时间), 
but we don't share common friends, common interests,
thats why i don't believe him or her too much, since there is no 筹码 on the trust, 
i think trust is based on the reputation on the network we shared


Even though I've known them for a long while and we are quite familiar, we don't share mutual friends or common interests. That's why I don't fully trust them—there is no leverage involved. I believe trust is built on reputation within a shared network.

💡 深度辨析：为什么 "I wish I didn't..." 听起来有点怪？

在英语中，I wish I didn't [do something] 通常用来描述你**“不喜欢现在的某种状态或习惯”**。

例 1（习惯）： "I wish I didn't smoke." (我希望我不抽烟。——指的是你现在有抽烟的习惯，你想戒掉。)

例 2（事实）： "I wish I didn't have to go." (我真希望我现在不用走。——指的是现在的状态。)

但是，当你谈论“睡觉 (sleep over)”这种一次性发生的动作时，通常都是指“昨天”或“那次”的事。所以，绝大多数情况下，用 "I wish I hadn't slept over" 会显得你英语更专业、更精准

告白

	西方文化中，直接的“告白”仪式不如东亚文化常见，更多是自然而然地"ask someone out"或"express your feelings"。
