The Lunar calendar is based on the phases of the Moon, with each month starting on a new moon. A lunar year has about 354 days, which is shorter than a solar year.
To align with the solar year, the Lunar calendar adds an extra month (a leap month) approximately every three years. This makes it a lunisolar calendar.

How many public holidays are there in Japan in a year?
 正月
 In Japan, the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) is not a public holiday. Instead, the main holiday is the New Year holiday (Shōgatsu, 正月), which typically runs from December 29 to January 3 for most public servants. 
  If you were specifically asking about celebrations related to the Lunar New Year, it is observed mainly by Chinese communities in Japan but not as a nationwide holiday.

 On New Year’s, our relatives usually gather at the home of the eldest family member. In my case, we typically reunite at my grandfather's house. We cook, eat, and watch the Spring Festival Gala together.
