⭐ IELTS Writing Task 2 — Band 8.5 Sample Essay

Topic:
Some people argue that reading original books is slow and inefficient, and that using AI tools such as ChatGPT to summarise the key ideas is a more effective method of learning. Others believe that only reading the original text can provide a full and reliable understanding of knowledge. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.


are turning to AI
never replace the depth and nuance found in the complete work.
Both perspectives have merit, and this essay will examine them before presenting my own view.



Some people believe job satisfaction is more more important than job security. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

Nowadays, while some people cares more about job satisfaction rather than job security. they more like to do a job that have meaning to them, they want to work at a company where employer and employees will respect each other. if they find a job not satisfied their need, they will chose to change a job. others believe having a stable job is more important than just job satisfaction.

People who pursue job satisfaction are usually young and ambitious, usually work for tech companies. for intance, who those have the age advantages, are more like to learn new skills such as cloud computings, AI generation skills which are very competitive in nowadays tech industry, once they mastered those high-end skill, they can gain the edge over people who just long-lasting doing the excel work at big company.

However, not all people are always trying to take risk changing job again and again. at a certain of age, 
some people prefer a stable job. There are some reasons for it, firstly, when people get older, besides their career, they also need pay atention to their family, usually they have kids, even though the person who work can take risk personally, but the family can not. also, a job have strong security can ofer a good retire pension when they leave thier job at 60 or so. whats more, people work a good stable job, usually who work in a big company, more like get respected by other poeple.

In my opinion, Whcih is moroe important between job satisfaction and job security depending on the person's age, risk tolerance, and occupation. For me, as a 30 years old tech person, i definitely prefer job satisfcation over job security. However, i am also planing at my age of 45, i will look for a big company that offer a stable job which give me stable paychecks so that put more of my energy to my family.
