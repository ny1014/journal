August Review
August was a month full of learning and new experiences. As a group, we faced both challenges and opportunities. Some of our main achievements included finishing our project tasks on time, improving communication within the team, and supporting each other during busy periods.
Of course, there were also difficulties. Time management was sometimes an issue, and we realized that clearer role assignments could help us work more efficiently. These are areas we can improve in the future.
Looking back, August taught us the importance of teamwork and adaptability. Moving into September, we hope to continue building stronger cooperation, set more realistic goals, and encourage open feedback.


One highlight was keeping a more consistent daily routine,

continue doing something 

 wake-up call 

August was a wake-up call for me. During my health check-up, I discovered several issues: multiple nodules in my lungs, a Helicobacter pylori infection in my stomach, weak kidney function, and high cholesterol levels.
These results made me realize that I can’t take my health for granted. I need to change my lifestyle and focus more on daily habits that support long-term well-being. It’s not just about treating these problems, but about building healthier routines step by step.

Looking back, August reminded me that health is the foundation of everything. Without it, it’s difficult to enjoy work, relationships, or personal growth.
