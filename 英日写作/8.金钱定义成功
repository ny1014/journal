Social status 

beyond material wealth

multifaceted concept

In modern society, success is often associated with financial achievement.
While some people believe that a person’s income is the best indicator of success, others argue that money alone cannot fully define it.

Many people equate success with wealth, believing that a high income reflects personal achievement.

This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and explain why I believe success should be defined in a broader sense.




Success

	some people can have success in the term of finance, but still be a loser in relationship.
	some poeple can have success in the term of both finance and relationship, but still can be unhappy due to psysical health.

Success is a broad concept that can be interpreted in different ways.

Some people may achieve success in terms of financial wealth, yet remain unsuccessful in their personal relationships.

Others may succeed in both their careers and relationships, but still feel unhappy due to poor physical health.

Therefore, when describing a person as truly successful in a general sense, I believe happiness should be the top priority.
In addition, a successful person should also have the ability to bring happiness to others.
