delegate
That’s a thoughtful approach! Decision-making can indeed be compromised when we’re tired. It’s smart to delegate important decisions to your well-rested self. 


I usually avoid making decisions at the end of the day when I feel tired.
When I'm tired, my mind becomes cloudy, so I’ve developed a habit of not trusting myself in the evening. Instead, I only rely on the version of me who has had a good night’s sleep.

if you can get improved your target language on this platform is totally depend on how you to use it...
and i find it pretty tricky to stick to initia purpose here.

the level of learner is varied pretty much,
the biggest paradox here is for advance learner, if you open a random room or join a random room, 
most of time the room end up with a chaos where has newbee who hardly speak the target language and unmature kids.
for beginer, its hardly to find a native speaker who patiently talk with you.
so, i just figure out the best way to gain most here is to create own room and invited same level learner and a native speaker who willing to teach you instead of join random room
