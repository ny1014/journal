What made you become you 
What shaped who you are today?
What influenced you the most growing up?


How did you become the person you are today? ✅
What was the first turning point in your life? ✅（加 was）
What was your biggest turning point?



今までで一番大変だった時期ってある？しんどかった時期とかある？
人生で最初の転機って、どんな時期だった？
Did you go through a difficult time?
Did you have a hard time that shaped who you are today?

Have you ever met someone who changed you?
Did you ever meet someone who had a big impact on you?

What’s the first thing you do in the morning?
What is your typical day like?


Do you have any regrets, if you do, whats that. 

if you are just let it go, or just 引きずる

Do you have any regrets? If so, what are they?

And do you let them go, or do you dwell on them?

where do you get key information from 
	Like Bloomberg, X, Insta, newspicks yahoo 

I wonder when my next turning point will be.
