I used to play League of Legends for two years, but I gradually got bored of it and stopped playing. I think the game is too repetitive and time comsuming, so I decided to explore more interesting single-player games instead.

I lose interest in playing them.

Do you prefer playing the same game continuously, or do you enjoy exploring new games more?
