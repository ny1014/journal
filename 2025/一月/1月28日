今天除夕 Chinese New Year's Eve

	Yes, Chinese New Year's Eve (除夕) is often more 热闹 (lively) than the next day!

	On New Year's Eve, families gather for a big reunion dinner (年夜饭), and the atmosphere is filled with excitement. People stay up late for 守岁 (shou sui), setting off fireworks, playing games, and watching the CCTV Spring Festival Gala (春节联欢晚会). The whole evening is about celebrating together and preparing to welcome the new year.

	The next day, Chinese New Year (大年初一), while still festive, is usually more focused on visiting relatives, exchanging greetings (拜年), and giving/receiving red envelopes (红包). It can feel a bit calmer compared to the high energy of the eve.

	Would you say you enjoy the lively vibes of the eve or the family visits on the next day more? 😊
